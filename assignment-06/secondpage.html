    <h2>A Short Story</h2><br />
    <p>Once apon a time, humans needed to warm themselves up. They started building fires and found that oxygen, heat and fuel are elements needed
    to create and keep a fire going. This solution for warmth was used throughout history, and while it did work, it couldn't heat large areas and
    it was hard to keep it going. Therefore, an idea to burn coal made its way into human history. This idea quickly spread and the concept of just
    buring coal changed. Humans started burning fossil fuels (aka fossilized remains of plants and animals). Burning coal and fossil fuels was effective
    and the energy created wasn't just for heat, but rather for a multitude of purposes, such as fueling cars and planes. While this idea was smart,
    humans quickly found out the harms of burning elements to create energy. Releasing CO2 into the atmosphere, warming up the planet, melting glaciers
    poluting water ways are all consequences of burning coal, fossil fuels. That is why humans started investing in renewable, clean energy. However,
    today, each year, 1.2 TRILLION gallons of untreated waste water that is polluted is dumped into the U.S. waters. Sadly, this is just in the U.S.
    Therefore, my art work I created below, represents this tragic situation humans have put themselves in. </p>
